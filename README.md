## Features

- **Data Loading**: Import and examine the Titanic dataset from a CSV file.
- **Data Cleaning**: Identify and handle missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
  - Analyze survival rates and distributions.
  - Visualize survival rates with pie charts and bar charts.
  - Examine survival patterns by gender and passenger class.
  - Explore survival rates based on the port of embarkation.
- **Visualization**:
  - Bar charts for gender and class distributions.
  - Pie charts for overall survival rates and gender proportions.
  - Bar plots and pie charts for survival rates by class and gender.
- **Passenger Filtering**: Locate and display data for specific passengers named Jack and Rose.
